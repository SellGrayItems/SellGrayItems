# SellGrayItems

*Formerly SellGrey by Paul Davis Tutherow Jr, project taken over by Serrol*

Adds a button to the Merchant frame that sells gray items; includes options to enable auto-sell and auto-repair.

## Options

### Auto-Sell

Instead of having to click the button, the addon will automatically sell every gray item in your inventory whenever you open a Merchant's window. Don't worry: the button will still be there just in case you want it.

### Auto-Repair

Whenever you visit a merchant that can repair your gear, having this option selected will automatically click on the repair button for you when the merchant's window is opened.

**Repair using guild bank funds (if available)**

If your guild allows you to repair using the money in the guild's bank, the addon will attempt to use those funds first. If there aren't enough funds for you to repair, it will use your personal money for any remaining amount.

### Show total value of gray items in bags

Calculates the total vendor value of all gray items in your bags, and then displays this price at the top of your primary bag. This updates whenever your bag does (which includes looting/selling items).

## Slash Commands

There are three slash commands that can be used to interact with this addon:

```
/sellgrayitems
/sellgrays
/sgi
```

With those slash commands, there are a few arguments that can be used for certain functions:

```
/sellgrayitems - Opens options page
/sellgrayitems h - Lists slash commands and available arguments
/sellgrayitems v - Displays version number in your chat window
```
